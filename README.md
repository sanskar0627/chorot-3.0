# 🚀 100xDevs Cohort 3.0 - Web Dev + DevOps 🚀

Welcome to my notes repository for **100xDevs Cohort 3.0 by Harkirat Singh**!  
This repo is a personal log of everything I’m learning — from **MERN stack** to **DevOps fundamentals** — with live code, notes, and mini-projects.

Whether you're a beginner or brushing up your skills, you'll find plenty of useful stuff here to **level up your development game!**

- ✅ **Live Notes & Demos**: My personal notes with annotated code and hands-on examples.
